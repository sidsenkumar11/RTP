The RTP Header includes a source/destination port.
However, RTP does no multiplexing of source/destination ports as this is taken care of at the OS level, so currently this part of the header is meaningless.

For now, default source_port is 1111


For now, seq and ack numbers both start at 0. They also don't wrap around. Needs to be randomized.

Choosing a Window Size is up to the implementer of RTP.
